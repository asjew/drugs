Footnote(s): For all HIV surveillance data: Data for the years 2020 and 2021 are preliminary (subject to a 12-month reporting lag). Rates are not reported until 12-month reporting lag complete.
Prevalence: Prevalence data for the year 2019 are preliminary and based on death data received by CDC as of December 2020. Trends through 2019 should be interpreted with caution. Prevalence data prior to 2010 are based on residence at diagnosis; prevalence data from 2010 to present are based on most recent known address. See Technical Notes for more information on death reporting by jurisdiction.
Death: Death data for the year 2019 are preliminary and based on death data received by CDC as of December 2020. Death data based on residence at death.

PrEP coverage, reported as a percentage, is calculated as the number of persons aged ≥16 years classified as having been prescribed PrEP divided by the estimated number of persons aged ≥16 years who had indications for PrEP.   Number prescribed, or “cases”, is defined as the number of persons aged ≥16 years classified as having been prescribed PrEP during the specified year and includes all FDA-approved drugs for PrEP.  “Population” is the annual estimated number of persons with PrEP indications. Total includes people categorized by IQVIA as Black, White, Hispanic, or Other race. Number prescribed are reported through September 2020. Data for which values are unknown were not reported; therefore, values may not sum to column total.
